destination: "uploads":
Specifies the folder (uploads/) where images will be stored.
filename: (req, file, cb) => { ... }:

Creates an upload middleware instance using the storage configuration above.
This will handle single-file uploads when a request is made.

Defines a POST route at /add for adding new food items.
upload.single("image"):
This middleware will handle the file upload before calling addFood.
"image" is the field name used in the form where the user uploads an image.
addFood:
The controller function that will process the request (insert food data into MongoDB).
