How is redux showing the items which are stored in the cart in the cart page?
How is cart.jsx is working??

Sure! I'd be happy to explain the code in detail. This is a part of a **React component** that uses **Redux** to manage the state of the **cart**. Let's go through it line by line:

### 1. **`const cart = useSelector((state) => state.cart);`**
   - **Purpose**: This line is accessing the **Redux store** to retrieve the `cart` state.
   - `useSelector`: This is a hook provided by **React-Redux** to access the state from the Redux store. You pass a **selector function** to it that specifies which part of the state you want to access.
   - **`(state) => state.cart`**: This is the **selector function**. It says, "Get the `cart` property from the global state (`state`), which is the cart's current state stored in Redux."

   **In simple terms**: You're retrieving the `cart` state from Redux, which will be an object representing the user's shopping cart (containing item IDs as keys and quantities as values).

### 2. **`const dispatch = useDispatch();`**
   - **Purpose**: This line is initializing the **dispatch function**.
   - `useDispatch`: This is another hook provided by **React-Redux**, and it gives you access to the **dispatch** function. The dispatch function is used to send **actions** to the Redux store to update its state.
   - This will be used later to trigger actions like adding, removing, or clearing items in the cart.

   **In simple terms**: You're setting up the ability to dispatch actions to update the Redux store (such as adding/removing items from the cart).

---

### 3. **`const cartItems = Object.keys(cart).map((id) => { ... });`**
   - **Purpose**: This line is transforming the `cart` object into an array of **cart items** with their details (like name, price, quantity).
   - `Object.keys(cart)`: This gets an array of **keys** (item IDs) from the `cart` object. For example, if the cart is `{ "item1": 2, "item2": 3 }`, then `Object.keys(cart)` will return `["item1", "item2"]`.
   - `.map((id) => { ... })`: The `map` function loops through each **item ID** (`id`), and for each item ID, it executes the callback function inside `{ ... }`. This is used to build an array of **item objects** that contain more details.

---

### 4. **`return { ...food_list.find((item) => item._id === id), quantity: cart[id] };`**
   - **Purpose**: This is the logic inside the `map` function to get the full details of the item from `food_list` and add the `quantity` from the Redux cart state.
   - `food_list.find((item) => item._id === id)`: This searches through the `food_list` (which is presumably an array of food items) and finds the item whose `_id` matches the `id` from the `cart`. So, for each item ID, you're finding the corresponding item details like the name, image, and price.
     - Example: If the `id` is `"item1"`, it will find the item in `food_list` with `_id === "item1"`.
   - `quantity: cart[id]`: Once the item is found, you're adding the `quantity` from the cart state (`cart[id]`) to the item. This will be the number of that item in the cart.
   - **Final Object**: The `return` statement will return a new object that contains both the item details (from `food_list`) and the `quantity` of that item (from `cart`).

   **In simple terms**: For each item ID in the cart, you're creating an object that contains both the **item's details** (like name, price) and the **quantity** from the cart, to display it properly on the UI.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's say `cart` in Redux is:
```javascript
{
  "item1": 2,  // 2 of item1
  "item2": 3   // 3 of item2
}
```

And `food_list` contains:
```javascript
[
  { _id: "item1", name: "Pizza", price: 200, image: "pizza.jpg" },
  { _id: "item2", name: "Burger", price: 150, image: "burger.jpg" }
]
```

After this code runs:

1. `Object.keys(cart)` will give `["item1", "item2"]`.
2. For each `id` in `["item1", "item2"]`, it will find the corresponding item in `food_list` and combine it with the quantity from the `cart`.

So, `cartItems` will look like this:
```javascript
[
  { _id: "item1", name: "Pizza", price: 200, image: "pizza.jpg", quantity: 2 },
  { _id: "item2", name: "Burger", price: 150, image: "burger.jpg", quantity: 3 }
]
```

Now, `cartItems` contains all the details needed to display the cart: the name, price, image, and quantity of each item.

---

### In summary:
- `cart` contains just the **item IDs and quantities**.
- `food_list` contains the **full details** of each food item (name, price, image, etc.).
- The `map` function creates a new array (`cartItems`) that combines the **item details** from `food_list` and the **quantity** from the `cart` so that you can render a detailed list of items in the cart.
